<h1>Today: Computing on Encrypted Data, Wed., April 22nd</h1>

<p>Guest lecture by Vinod Vaikuntanathan</p>

<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>Traditional encryption is "all-or-nothing": put the secret message in a locked
box, send it to the person. If he has the key he can decrypt, otherwise he can't
do anything.</p>

<p>Non-malleable encryption: if adversary intercepts ciphertext he cannot do anything
(flip bits, etc) or learn anything from it.</p>

<h2>Encryption for cloud computing</h2>

<p>You want to compute a function <code>F</code> over the encrypted data of an user. But the
user wants its privacy.</p>

<p>Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), by Rivest, Adleman, Dertouzos (1978):</p>

<pre><code>                Enc(Data)
            &lt;--------------    
Cloud                           user
                Enc(F(Data))
            ---------------&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>They had no solution for FHE, just an idea that it might be possible.</p>

<p>Classes of computation:</p>

<ul>
<li>fully = any function F
<ul>
<li>for the moment, we think about circuits as the model of computation
<ul>
<li>(boolean, arithmetic, doesn't matter)</li>
<li>doesn't support loops whose condition depends on input variables</li>
<li>but can get around it by trying a loop for 10 iterations on the FHE
side, then client-side can tell FHE side that it did not get the 
correct answer (not clear how it would verify correctness?) => then
FHE side can retry</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>additive = only additions</li>
<li>multiplicative = only multiplications</li>
<li>somewhat = circuits of small depth</li>
</ul>

<p>Gentry, 2009 introduced the first FHE construction.</p>

<h2>Outline</h2>

<ul>
<li>multiplicative homorphism (ElGamal)
<ul>
<li><code>E(x1), E(x2) =&gt; E(x1+x2)</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>additive homomorphisms (Goldwasser Micalli)
<ul>
<li><code>E(x1), E(x2) =&gt; E(x1*x2)</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>FHE</li>
</ul>

<p>If we have addition and multiplication, then we have FHE.</p>

<p>For over 30 years we knew how to do addition and multiplication, but within 
different encryption schemes => no FHE</p>

<h2>ElGamal</h2>

<p>We've seen it before in class.</p>

<pre><code>Enc(m1): (g^r1, y^r1*m1)
Enc(m2): (g^r2, y^r2*m1)
------------------------
Enc(m2*m2): (g^(r2*r1), y^(r2*r1)*m1*m2)
</code></pre>

<h2>GM</h2>

<p>Public key: <code>N = pq, y = non-square mod N</code>
Secret key: factorization of <code>N</code></p>

<p>In <code>Z_N*</code> some numbers can be written as squares and others can't.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Z_n*</code> is the set of all numbers <code>x, s.t gcd(x,n) = 1</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Encryption:</p>

<pre><code>Enc(0): r^2 mod N
Enc(1): y* r^2 mod N
</code></pre>

<p>Computationally hard to distinguish between squares and non-squares in <code>Z_N*</code>,
unless you know the factorization of <code>N</code></p>

<p>XOR homomorphic, just multiply the ciphertexts:</p>

<ul>
<li>square(0) * square(0) = square(0)</li>
<li>non-square(1) * square(0)  = non-square(1)</li>
<li>square(0) * non-square(1) = square(1)</li>
<li>non-square(1) * non-square(1) = square(0)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other HE schemes</h2>

<p>Additive for numbers larger than 1 bit</p>

<ul>
<li>Paillier</li>
<li>Damgard-Jurik</li>
</ul>

<p>Additions + a single multiplication</p>

<ul>
<li>Boneh-Goh-Nissim (based on gap groups)</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to construct an FHE scheme</h2>

<p>Step 1: Somewhat homomorphic encryption (SwHE): We know how to do additions and just
one multiplications. Can we extend it to 10 multiplications? Or more?</p>

<ul>
<li><code>n</code> security parameter, SwHE lets you compute circuits of depth <code>d = \epsilon*log(n)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Step 2: Bootstrapping theorem (Gentry 2009): Says that "homomorphic-enough" encryption <code>=&gt;*</code> FHE</p>

<p>Homomorphic-enough means that the scheme can evaluate a deep enough circuit. Deep
enough means the scheme can evaluate its own decryption circuits (plus some).
Note that decryption circuits are well-defined and don't have unbounded loops.</p>

<p>Step 3: Depth boosting / Modulus reduction: Takes a SwHE scheme that can
compute <code>log(n)</code> circuits and boosts it to <code>O(n)</code> circuits.</p>

<h2>The NTRU encryption scheme</h2>

<p>Central characters: ring (add and multiply) of polynomials modulo <code>q</code> of bounded
degree (when you multiply two polynomials, the degree grows, but reduction modulo <code>q</code> helps reduce it)</p>

<p>Polynomials of degree less than <code>n</code></p>

<p>Example (q = 11):</p>

<ul>
<li>addition is modulo 11 for the coefficients</li>
<li>multiplications is modulo (11, x^4 + 1)</li>
</ul>

<p>Ring: <code>R_q := Z_q[X] / (x^n + 1)</code></p>

<pre><code>KeyGen():
    sample two "small" polynomials, `f, g \in R_q` with coefficients `&lt;= B` ,
    s.t. `f=1 mod 2`

    secret key = f, public key = h = 2g/f
    (sample again if f has no inverse)
    (multiplying the public key by f, almost "kills" h in the sense
     that the product is small)

Encryption(m \in {0,1}): 
    sample "small" polynomials s,e \in R_q
    output C = hs + m (mod q, x^n+1)
        (s sort of randomizes the encryption)
    is this semantically secure? you have to add randomness cleverly.
    if m = 0, (hs + m) * h^-1 = s + m*h^-1 = s (small)
    if m = 1, (hs + m) * h^-1 = s + m*h^-1 = s + h^-1 (not small)
      =&gt; not semantically secure

    output C = hs + 2e + m (mod q, x^n+1)
        (s sort of randomizes the encryption)
    if m = 0, (hs + 2e + m) * h^-1 = s + 2eh^-1 + m*h^-1 (large)
    if m = 1, (hs + 2e + m) * h^-1 = s + 2eh^-1 + m*h^-1 (large)

Decryption(C):

    output fC (mod q, X^n+1) mod 2
    fC = f(hs + 2e + m) = 2(gs + fe) + fm (mod q, x^n+1)
    (can't just take the mod 2 of this because ((mod q) mod 2) does not commute)

    this polynomial has small coefficients though, so the mod q has no effect
    if |2(gs+fe) + fm)| &lt; q/2, taking mod 2 gives m
</code></pre>

<p>You can show that this scheme is as secure as solving the shortest vector problem
on lattices (SVP)</p>

<p>Note that there's no factoring, no discrete logarithm. This relies on the fact
that if I give you a bunch of linear equations for ciphertexts in this scheme,
it is hard to extract the secret or the messages.</p>

<pre><code>\vecS = (s1, ..., sn) \in Z_2^n

I can give you:
\veca1, a1 \cdot s
...
\veca1, am \cdot s

Your goal is to find s. You can do this with Gaussian elimination.


However, if I give you noisy equations with e_i, where P(e_i = 1) = p:
\veca1, a1 \cdot s + e_1
...
\veca1, am \cdot s + e_m

The only solution is to check all possible assignments of \vecS and see
if the distribution of the e_i's you get out matches P(e_i)
</code></pre>

<p>Additive homomorphism for NTRU:</p>

<pre><code>c1 = hs1 + 2e1 + m1
c2 = hs2 + 2e2 + m2
----
c1+c2 = h(s1+s2) + 2(e1+e2) + m1+m2
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you cannot do too many additions because <code>e</code> needs to be a small
polynomial => this is a SwHE scheme</p>

<p>What happens when I decrypt these ciphertexts?</p>

<pre><code>fc1 = 2E1 + fm1
fc2 = 2E2 + fm2
</code></pre>

<p>What about decrypting the sum?</p>

<pre><code>f(c1+c2) = 2(E1+E2) + f(m1+m2)
f(c1+c2) = 2(E1+E2) + f(m1+m2)
</code></pre>

<p>Multiplication?</p>

<pre><code>f(c1*c2) = 2(E1m2 + E2m1 + 2E1E2) + f^2(m1*m2)
             \---------|--------/
                       E
=&gt; I need to use a different secret (f^2) to retrieve m1 * m2
</code></pre>

<p>Problem: these errors grow, and they cannot grow beyond a certain amount (<code>q/2</code> or
<code>q/4</code> or the wraparound will not allow you to decrypt)</p>

<p>Let's look at addition:</p>

<pre><code>f(c1+c2) = 2(E1+E2) + f(m1+m2)
the noise is at most 2*B, if E1 &lt; B and E2 &lt; B

f(c1*c2) = 2(E1m2 + E2m1 + 2E1E2) + f^2(m1*m2)
norm of E1E2 is at most nB^2 (due to the reduction in R_q)

after d levels, noise is (nB)^(2^d)

if noise &lt;= q/2 &lt;= B * 2^(n^\epsilon) we re good
=&gt; d &lt;= log(log q) - log(log nB) &lt;=~ \epsilon log(n) - log(log(n))
</code></pre>

<h2>The bootstrapping method</h2>

<p>Theorem: If you can homomorphically evaluate circuits of depth d and the
depth of your decryption circuit &lt; d then you can convert it into an FHE
scheme.</p>

<p>How? What is the best possible noise reduction algorithm that you can think of?
DECRYPTION!!</p>

<p>You encrypt your data, server computes, gets too much noise, now server needs
to decrypt! But that would break security! The next best thing: "homomorphic 
decryption": I have a scheme which can compute circuits of small depths, and
the decryption algorithm is of small depth => Can decrypt "homomorphically" =>
get back a reencrypted plain text. But I would need the secret key to know
the decryption circuit. Maybe the encrypted secret key suffices.</p>

<p>Assume you can use the public key to encrypt the secret key (circular secure).</p>

<p>TODO: kind of weird how the Dec(ctext, sk) is turned into Dec(ctext, enc_pk(sk))</p>

<p>We need the noise we get out of the homomorphic decryption to be independent 
of the noise in the input ciphertext. </p>
