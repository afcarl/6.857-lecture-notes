<h2>Atoms vs. Bits</h2>

<ul>
<li>Possessing value means what?</li>
<li>How to transfer value?</li>
</ul>

<p>Bit-based system: bits can be copied (double spending)</p>

<p><strong>Token-based representation:</strong> like actual coins</p>

<p><strong>Account-based representation:</strong> like banks that store your value for you, you have to trust them</p>

<p>Bit-coin is <em>still an account-based system</em>, but it's distributed and less trust
needs to be put in. No central authority.</p>

<p>Let's think of what an electronic system would look like</p>

<ul>
<li>User <code>u</code> has some public key <code>pk_u</code> and some secret key <code>sk_u</code>.</li>
<li>The bank (one global bank) would have its own public key <code>pk_b</code> and secret
key <code>sk_b</code> and can certify user <code>u</code>
<ul>
<li>it signs a certificate <code>cert(u, pk_u) = sign_{sk_b}(u | pk_u)</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>What is a check?
<ul>
<li><code>sign_{sk_u}("Pay Bob $100, date, ser #")</code>
<ul>
<li>serial number is used to prevent a merchant from charging user <code>u</code>
multiple times using the same check</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Properties that a currency or monetary system might have that the check system
above does not? Or properties in general!</p>

<ul>
<li>No trusted third party (like the bank above)</li>
<li>anonymity (a check would reveals payer and payee)</li>
<li>unique coins (not sure what difference they are pointing at here between this
currency and the electronic system above)</li>
<li>no single point of failure</li>
<li>fast transactions</li>
<li>control of money supply
<ul>
<li>interesting topic in itself</li>
</ul></li>
<li>no double spending</li>
<li>cheap transactions</li>
<li>scalable (handle millions of transactions a day)</li>
<li>hard to forge (can't make new money, or new payments)</li>
<li>need a way to reverse transactions (like chargeback)</li>
<li>fraud management/detection</li>
<li>variable denominations ($1, $2, $5, $10, $20)</li>
<li>divisibility</li>
<li>backup value (in Bitcoin losing your SK is disastrous) </li>
<li>exchange w/ other systems</li>
<li>DDOS resistance</li>
<li>taxation/regulation?</li>
<li>compelling for people to use?</li>
<li>good for micropayments</li>
</ul>

<p>Can be hard to prevent system rollback, which can lead to double spending. Can
you detect it?</p>

<p>What would an electronic coin look like?</p>

<ul>
<li>TTP: bank</li>
<li>Payer: Alice</li>
<li>Payee: Bob</li>
<li>Need authorization protocol for withdrawal</li>
<li>Need protocol for payment</li>
</ul>

<p>Diagram:</p>

<pre><code>                TTP (bank accounts)
             /       *
            /         \
withdrawal /           \ deposit
          /             \
         *               \
      Alice   -------&gt;   Bob
              payment
</code></pre>

<p>Coin:</p>

<ul>
<li>some random number <code>R</code> that is the coin's ID with a digital signature from
the bank <code>s = sign_{sk_bank}(R)</code>
<ul>
<li>the coin is <code>c = R,s</code> </li>
</ul></li>
<li>bank has to keep an <em>unspent coins DB</em> <code>{r1, r2, ...,}</code> to prevent double spending</li>
<li>when Alice wants to pay Bob, she can just give the coin <code>c = R, s</code>
<ul>
<li>Bob cannot verify whether coin <code>c</code> is unspent, until it's too late</li>
<li>Bank can tell if someone is double spending <code>c</code> but the bank cannot
identify <em>who</em> is double spending the coin
<ul>
<li>it could be that Bob is double spending the coin <code>c</code> he got from Alice</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>

<p>Mixes a few ideas: </p>

<ul>
<li>electronic checks</li>
<li>HashCash</li>
<li>public ledger (blockchain) probably the most innovative idea</li>
</ul>

<p>The history of all transactions is public! Not maintained by trusted party, but
via a broadcast system.</p>

<p>How do you identify parties? What are the identities?</p>

<ul>
<li>Bitcoin uses public key crypto to identify people. </li>
<li>Note one person can have multiple key pairs.</li>
<li>The account name is the public key and has a value associated with it on the public ledger</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Public ledger:</strong> for each account, how much value is there in it?</p>

<ul>
<li>really it stores all transactions, so you can infer the value in each account</li>
</ul>

<p>Money is created by those maintaining the public ledger (miners)</p>

<ul>
<li>miners add new transactions to the ledger
<ul>
<li>they get rewarded some bitcoins when they solve the puzzle required for this</li>
<li>no other way to create value in bitcoin (other than transaction fees?)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Transaction details:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bitcoin transactions allow multiple input accounts (payers) and multiple
output accounts (payees)
<ul>
<li>This is sometimes used to give change to yourself by setting one of the
output accounts as your account
<ul>
<li>in practice people create new accounts and put their change in it, to
preserve their anonymity</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>you don't wanna make it to easy adding to the ledger, otherwise people add
too much junk
<ul>
<li>HashCash scheme solves this</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>It can happen that two miners came up with a block at the same time and both add
it, forking the chain</p>

<pre><code>[] -&gt; [] -&gt; [] -&gt; [] -&gt;  [] 
                     \
           A-&gt;B       -&gt; []
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> wait like 6 blocks to make sure the incorporated blocks are
really there and are not part of a fork that died</p>

<ul>
<li>this is not that great though</li>
</ul>

<p>Scalability:</p>

<ul>
<li>BitCoin does like 7 transactions / second, VISA does like 3000/sec</li>
<li>fee that miners are getting halves every year
<ul>
<li>TODO: How is this implemented?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>after no fees, transaction fees will be used to reward miners
<ul>
<li>but total # of bitcons will remain the same</li>
<li>except people lose their wallets, so some bitcoins will be inaccessible =>
problems</li>
</ul></li>
<li>it's becoming harder to be a miner
<ul>
<li>monopoly on mining actually (Ghash holds half the supply of bitcoins?)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>cannot create money by loaning?</li>
<li>"Majority is not enough" paper</li>
