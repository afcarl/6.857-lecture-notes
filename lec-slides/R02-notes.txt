Recitation 2:
Analysis of One Time Pad improperly used. We looked at a proposal which would xor the message with the xor of two different sources of randomness. The idea is that the simple xor recovery trick for a reused one time pad would not work. The randomness are R,G,B. The outputs are R xor G, B xor G, (R xor B) xor m. The way to decrypt without the keys is to xor all three messages together.

Proof that Perfect Secrecy implies the keyspace is at least as big as the message space. The proof is in Katz-Lindell. The main steps are to first assume that it is not true and fix the message distribution to be uniform, this guarantees that every message occurs with nonzero probability. For a given ciphertext, we take the set of possible decryptions for that cipher under each possible key in the keyspace and call this set M(c). We note that |M(c)| <= |K| because every decryption comes from a key. Since |M(c)| < M, then there is a message which is in the message space, but not a valid decryption. This violates the perfect secrecy which states that P(m | c) = P(m).
